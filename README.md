# Autonomous Surface-Water Vehicle - Harvey Mudd College ENGR80 Sp '18
This project involved creating an autonomous surface-water vehicle that would autonomously navigate to
collect temperature and turbidity (cloudiness of water) data in the field. Two navigation methods were
investigated that may be of interest to the public:
1) Navigate to waypoints: P-Control using a GPS and IMU 
2) Navigate toward a continuously transmitting RF beacon: Relies on a directionalized antenna. Steers to maximize power as a function of antenna angle relative to the transmitting beacon.
